## Pre-Release

#### Bingo Rules
Bingo is a game of probability in which players mark off numbers on cards as the numbers are drawn randomly by a caller, the winner being the first person to mark off all their numbers. 
A typical bingo ticket is shown below. It contains 27 spaces, arranged in nine columns by three rows. Each row contains five numbers and four blank spaces. 

- The first column contains numbers from 1 to 10
- The second column numbers from 11 to 20
- The third, 21 to 30 and so on up until the last column, which contains numbers from 81 to 90

The game is presided over by a caller, whose job it is to call out the numbers. The caller will usually say "Eyes down" to indicate that he is about to start. The caller then begins to call numbers as they are randomly selected, using a mechanical draw machine filled with 90 balls. Calling is performed by reading out the number but some numbers have special calls due to their significance, eg legs eleven or two little ducks.
The game is won by achieving a full house, which is covering all fifteen numbers on the ticket.

#### Bingo Bonus
In the game Bingo Bonus players can also win in the following ways
- Four corners - the leftmost and rightmost numbers on the top and bottom lines
- Line – covering a horizontal line of five numbers on the ticket

#### Bingo Sim
The game BingoSim players can simulate the exciting game of Bingo in the comfort of their computer chair. The system starts by giving them the choice of playing standard bingo or bingo bonus (with the extra winning methods).
In standard bingo the player is assigned a UK style Bingo card. The game then randomly “calls” the numbers out, including any significant calls. At any point the player can claim that they have won. The system should then “verify” the card and either display “GAME OVER” or that they have won.

In the Bingo Bonus game players can claim to have won in several different ways. If a player claims that they have won the system should check if they have achieved Four Corners, a Line or a full house. If they have it displays an appropriate message and that they have won. If they are wrong display “GAME OVER”.

There is a practice game setting where the numbers are not randomised but output in the following order:
4,11,47,57,65,33,48,58,68,78,5,18,50,59,80
